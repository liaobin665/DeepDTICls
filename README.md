# DeepDTICls
## requirements:

tensorflow
sklearn
pandas
numpy
...
and + support packages for some drug molecule encoding methods (e.g.  ECFPs, PubChem, Daylight, Rdkit2D, Mol2vec, and ESPF..)

## Directory description:
1.data: Data storage directory, including the original data + encoded data (Note: Due to the 25M upload limit for a single file, some of the data files over 25M need to be generated by re-running the data pre-processing program).
2. data_process: Data pre-processing, and basic statistical information of data, etc.
3.dataPubChem: Specially for pubchem encoded data and processing directory.
4.log/logs: directory for generating tensorboard model information.
5.model: Model python implementation
6.trainCombineModel: The directory where the training CombineModel, code and its tensorboard, results are stored.
7. trainModel: train single coding model, for storing the code and its tensorboard, the storage directory of the results
8.compareClassfier: Compare the classfier directory
